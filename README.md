# BLT Equation: time domain application

It is a personal repo containing a Python based implementation of the Baum-Liu-Tesche (BLT) equation.

It contains:
- Basic Tesche implementation for time-domain calculation of the current induced on a transmission line (Tl) by a plane wave.
- More tests/validations/etc. to be added

## Purpose of this repo

To gather publicly available theory and techniques that I like and I am personally interested in, and write them down into usable bits of code. 


## Documentation

For now we use the markdown standard for Jupyter Notebooks to document on-the-fly.
